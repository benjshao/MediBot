# MediBot
A medical prescription reminder bot that takes advantage of Discord to connect physicians and pharmacists to their patients. It allows 
the health care professional to set a medical prescription reminder for their patients, as well as to keep track of the patient's adherence 
to the prescription. It is also able to chart the patient's medical information.

A hackathon project built during McHacks 8 at McGill University
